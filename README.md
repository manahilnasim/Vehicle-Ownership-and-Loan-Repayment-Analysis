# Vehicle-Ownership-and-Loan-Repayment-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between vehicle ownership and loan repayment capabilities among applicants. The analysis is aimed at understanding how owning a vehicle might influence an applicant's ability to repay loans, assuming that vehicle ownership is indicative of financial stability and asset accumulation.

# Contents
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis on vehicle ownership
- Statistical analysis to identify trends and insights
- Visualization of findings

# Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to derive insights related to vehicle ownership and assess its impact on loan repayment ability among different applicant groups. This can help financial institutions tailor their loan offerings and risk assessments more effectively.

# Tools Used
- Python: For performing data manipulation and analysis.
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data handling and visualization.

# How to Run the Notebook
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Google Colab to open the .ipynb file.
- Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
- Copy code
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

# Future Work
Enhance the model by including more variables such as income level, employment status, and more to deepen the analysis.
Implement machine learning techniques to predict loan repayment probabilities based on various applicant features.
